## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/node-call.git
   cd node-call
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open in browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
5. Share the room ID with another user to start a call.

## Folder Structure

```
node-call/
â”‚â”€â”€ public/           # Static assets (HTML, CSS, client JS)
â”‚â”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js     # Express and Socket.io server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ webrtc.js     # WebRTC signaling and logic
â”‚â”€â”€ views/            # HTML templates (e.g., using EJS or plain HTML)
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

* Users enter a room ID to join a video chat room.
* **Socket.io** handles room creation and signaling.
* **WebRTC** establishes direct peer-to-peer connections.
* Chat messages are exchanged through the same Socket.io connection.
